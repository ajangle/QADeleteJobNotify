# Application: DeleteJobNotify.jar


## What the application will do.


1) The application will monitor the progress of a delete job by running a query against the oracle database twice after a set interval.
	
2) The application wil then compare the count and see if there a difference.

3) If there is a difference, the application will then print out the appropriate message. This will act as a notification to ensure that job runs without manual monitoring.
